name: repo-documenter
description: Comprehensive documentation generator for repositories and sub-repositories. Use this skill when the user wants to understand a codebase, generate README files, create architecture documentation, or document specific modules. It provides tools to map the repository structure and templates for standard documentation files.

# Repo Documenter

This skill helps you create thorough documentation for any repository.

## When to Use
Use this skill when:
- The user asks to "document this repo" or "explain this codebase".
- You need to create a `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, or `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- You are onboarding into a new project and need to understand the structure.

## Workflow

### 1. Map the Territory
First, get a high-level view of the repository structure to understand what you are working with.

Run the `generate_structure.py` script:
\`\`\`bash
python SKILLS/repo-documenter/scripts/generate_structure.py [path_to_repo]
\`\`\`
*Note: If no path is provided, it defaults to the current directory.*

### 2. Analyze Key Files
Based on the structure, identify and read key configuration and entry point files to understand the project's purpose and dependencies.

- **Node.js**: `package.json`
- **Python**: `setup.py`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`
- **General**: `docker-compose.yml`, `Makefile`

### 3. Plan the Documentation
Propose a documentation plan to the user. Common documents include:
- **README.md**: High-level overview, installation, usage.
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: System design, data flow, component breakdown.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Developer guidelines.
- **API Reference**: Detailed function/class documentation (if applicable).

### 4. drafted Content
Use the templates provided in `references/templates.md` to structure your documentation.

**To View Templates:**
\`\`\`
view_file SKILLS/repo-documenter/references/templates.md
\`\`\`

**Drafting Process:**
1.  **Overview**: Summarize the project's goal.
2.  **Installation/Usage**: precise commands based on your analysis of config files.
3.  **Structure**: Use the output from `generate_structure.py` to explain the folder layout.
4.  **Components**: Describe key modules found during analysis.

## Tips
- **1st Thing should be a what is going to how the useage is going to look like**: At one glance the user should be able to understand what is happening, from the user pov i.e. what is the input and what will be the output that this model will produce
- **Be Concise**: Users want actionable info, not fluff.
- **Verify Commands**: Ensure installation/run commands are actually valid based on the codebase.
- **Update Existing**: If a `README.md` already exists, offer to improve it rather than overwrite it, unless asked.
- **For Codebase Guides**: It should tailored so that using that codebase documentation guide, a new mamber of the team should be able to understand how to use the modules in this  file.
