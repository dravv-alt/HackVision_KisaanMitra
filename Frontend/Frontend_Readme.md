Respect traditional farmer mental models

Emphasize voice-first interaction

Avoid visual overload

Feel trustworthy and supportive




STRICT NOTICE :
Keep the color theme to

Light green , Yellow , Beige , Light Brownish Yellow
Colors pointing to farmers and a very calm choice of colors and theme so that the farmers don't get overwhelmed.
Don't use flashy colors or neon colors
Don't use dark templates at all
Only strictly use farm related colors - light soft green , beige color, yellow color.


Things to note - 
Make sure the web UI should be such that if needed it could be converted to mobile native responsive UI easily.
Make the UI such that it can be easily understood by a farmer.
React native is preferred. 
Based on the above develop the implementation plan. 
The only constraint is the UI should be very calm and farmer friendly and should not be overwhelming for the farmers.
The last thing to remind you again is that the code should be of such format or coding language that it can be further modified in the future into a mobile native app.
It is the core requirement so please plan accordingly, we need to build a mobile native app in the future.
For now our current goal is to develop a web app that can be easily converted into a mobile native app in the future.
The details are mentioned above.
